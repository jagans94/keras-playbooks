# TO DO:

This is a list of still *pending* work, in the completed (I know that sounds "oxymoronic") sections of the **'Keras Playbooks'**.

The *pending* sections have been tagged with **WIP** in the respective notebooks. 

#### 1.1 Guide to the Sequential model - I

- ​

#### 1.2 Guide to the Sequential model - II (WIP)

- ​

#### 2.1 Guide to the Functional API - I

- ​

#### 2.2 Guide to the Functional API - II

- ​

#### 3. FAQ 

- How can I run a Keras model on multiple GPUs? 
- How can I save a Keras model? - Handling custom layers (or other custom objects) in saved models
- How can I use stateful RNNs?
- How can I obtain reproducible results using Keras during development?
