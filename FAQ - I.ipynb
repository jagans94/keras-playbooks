    "### How can I run a Keras model on multiple GPUs?\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend doing so using the **TensorFlow** backend. There are two ways to run a single model on multiple GPUs: **data parallelism** and **device parallelism**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, what you need is most likely data parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "Data parallelism consists in replicating the target model once on each device, and using each replica to process a different fraction of the input data.\n",
    "Keras has a built-in utility, `keras.utils.multi_gpu_model`, which can produce a data-parallel version of any model, and achieves quasi-linear speedup on up to 8 GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see the documentation for [multi_gpu_model](/utils/#multi_gpu_model). Here is a quick example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.utils import multi_gpu_model\n",
    "\n",
    "# Replicates `model` on 8 GPUs.\n",
    "# This assumes that your machine has 8 available GPUs.\n",

    "\n",
    "# This `fit` call will be distributed on 8 GPUs.\n",
    "# Since the batch size is 256, each GPU will process 32 samples.\n",

    "#### Device parallelism\n",

    "Device parallelism consists in running different parts of a same model on different devices. It works best for models that have a parallel architecture, e.g. a model with two branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be achieved by using TensorFlow device scopes. Here is a quick example:\n",

    "### What does \"sample\", \"batch\", \"epoch\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some common definitions that are necessary to know and understand to correctly utilize Keras:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample**: one element of a dataset.\n",
    "  - *Example:* one image is a **sample** in a convolutional network\n",
    "  - *Example:* one audio file is a **sample** for a speech recognition model\n",
    "- **Batch**: a set of *N* samples. The samples in a **batch** are processed independently, in parallel. If training, a batch results in only one update to the model.\n",
    "  - A **batch** generally approximates the distribution of the input data better than a single input. The larger the batch, the better the approximation; however, it is also true that the batch will take longer to process and will still result in only one update. For inference (evaluate/predict), it is recommended to pick a batch size that is as large as you can afford without going out of memory (since larger batches will usually result in faster evaluating/prediction).\n",
    "- **Epoch**: an arbitrary cutoff, generally defined as \"one pass over the entire dataset\", used to separate training into distinct phases, which is useful for logging and periodic evaluation.\n",
    "  - When using `evaluation_data` or `evaluation_split` with the `fit` method of Keras models, evaluation will be run at the end of every **epoch**.\n",
    "  - Within Keras, there is the ability to add [callbacks](https://keras.io/callbacks/) specifically designed to be run at the end of an **epoch**. Examples of these are learning rate changes and model checkpointing (saving)."

    "### How can I save a Keras model?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving/loading whole models (architecture + weights + optimizer state)\n",
    "\n",
    "*It is not recommended to use pickle or cPickle to save a Keras model.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `model.save(filepath)` to save a Keras model into a single HDF5 file which will contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the architecture of the model, allowing to re-create the model\n",
    "- the weights of the model\n",
    "- the training configuration (loss, optimizer)\n",
    "- the state of the optimizer, allowing to resume training exactly where you left off.\n",

    "`load_model` will also take care of compiling the model using the saved training configuration\n",

    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.models import load_model\n",
    "\n",
    "model.save('my_model.h5')  # creates a HDF5 file 'my_model.h5'\n",

    "# returns a compiled model\n",
    "# identical to the previous one\n",
    "model = load_model('my_model.h5')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving/loading only a model's architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only need to save the **architecture of a model**, and not its weights or its training configuration, you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# save as JSON\n",
    "json_string = model.to_json()\n",
    "\n",
    "# save as YAML\n",
    "yaml_string = model.to_yaml()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated JSON / YAML files are human-readable and can be manually edited if needed.\n",

    "# model reconstruction from JSON:\n",
    "from keras.models import model_from_json\n",
    "model = model_from_json(json_string)\n",
    "\n",

    "from keras.models import model_from_yaml\n",
    "model = model_from_yaml(yaml_string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving/loading only a model's weights\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to save the **weights of a model**, you can do so in HDF5 with the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you will first need to install HDF5 and the Python library h5py, which do not come bundled with Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.save_weights('my_model_weights.h5')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have code for instantiating your model, you can then load the weights you saved into a model with the *same* architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5', by_name=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Assuming the original model looks like this:\n",
    "    model = Sequential()\n",

    "# load weights from first model; will only affect the first layer, dense_1.\n",
    "model.load_weights(fname, by_name=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling custom layers (or other custom objects) in saved models\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model you want to load includes custom layers or other custom classes or functions, \n",
    "you can pass them to the loading mechanism via the `custom_objects` argument: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.models import load_model\n",
    "# Assuming your model includes instance of an \"AttentionLayer\" class\n",
    "model = load_model('my_model.h5', custom_objects={'AttentionLayer': AttentionLayer})\n",

    "with CustomObjectScope({'AttentionLayer': AttentionLayer}):\n",

    "\n",
    "Besides, the training loss is the average of the losses over each batch of training data. Because your model is changing over time, the loss over the first batches of an epoch is generally higher than over the last batches. On the other hand, the testing loss for an epoch is computed using the model as it is at the end of the epoch, resulting in a lower loss."
