# Keras - Playbooks
This is a notebook version of the Keras documentation. Read the documentation at [Keras.io](https://keras.io).

## Why create a notebook version?
Do you need to even ask? There are many reasons to do so:
 - Experimentation: It's easier to experiment and understand than just read IMHO ;).
 - Incomplete examples: The examples in the documentation are sometimes incomplete, i.e. missing `import` statements, input data etc.
 - Depth: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, but also offers a lot of depth w.r.t customization. For example, most implementations you might find online, just use the `Sequential` model type for model building, which is a very small part of the entire API.
 - [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow): I can't do the same with Tensorflow. Have you seen it's API documentation? Damn!!
 
## What this is?
It's a collection of play/practice books where you'll learn to use **Keras** in much more depth through experimentation. 

## What this is not?
It's not a tutorial for Keras. Period.

## Citation: 
 - This was inspired from Nathaniel's [A Bit of Deep Learning and Keras](https://github.com/knathanieltucker/a-bit-of-deep-learning-and-keras/tree/master/notebooks).   
 - If you're new or just started learning Keras, I recommend watching Nathaniel's [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgJhDSE2ZLxaPX0jteHZG4skdj8ZrST9d) for **Keras**.

## Disclaimer: 
 - The original content has been sourced from Nathaniel's repository and all thanks go to him for the initial work.
 - That said, I'll be making drastic changes to it, while trying to remain as close to the Keras documentation as possible. 
 - Advanced sections (concept-wise) might not be covered initially. 
 - All contents are the same as they are in the documentation ~ just executable.
 
 ## Checklist: In Progress
 - [x] **Guide to Sequential Model**
 - [x] **Guide to Functional API**
 - [ ] **Remaining**
